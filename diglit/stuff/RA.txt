the main reason why i think a lot of people moved to chicago between :lparen 1830 :dash 1930 :rparen is because they would have better life because of the better job they had available for families that lost their farm to wars :comma change of weather :comma insect that ate the cotton crops :comma and the fungus disease that destroyed the potato crops in 1845 :period

so many came to chicago to find better jobs because they were opening more jobs over here in chicago :period
another reason many people moved to chicago was because many people wanted to get a good paying job and knew they could by getting a job in one of the three industries we have in railroading :comma meat processing :comma and retail stores :period
but that |wasn't| just it people who had farms had massive floods and their crops will wash away or mess up plus they came for the jobs because where they were they did not have to many job s to choose from so they moved the chicago :period
a lot of people moved to chicago between 1830 to 1930 because they needed more jobs and money to support their families and it jobs grew a lot in chicago and like people needed money they decided to move to chicago they also wanted to get a career so that is one of the reasons why so of the people moved to chicago between 1830 to 1930 :period
