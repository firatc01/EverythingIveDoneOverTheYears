in the united states the civil war was going on and their was no way to farm in the south of the united states :period
people |couldn't| farm also because of wars that were going on and farmers may have to serve the army :period

also people wanted a better life because of the wars they |didn't| have a decent life like we do :period
their crops were destroyed by insects :comma the weather :comma or by war :period
most of the crops were destroyed by war so farmers had to work in other lands so they will get paid very little money so they needed to find a better job to have enough money to buy anything they need to survive :period
the farmers would look for jobs that ware easy for them because it was easier for them to learn it to get money to eat have a home to live on then they change the way of farming they would plant crops in the south many people hade to work hard and get paid very little |that's| another reason people moved to chicago :period
they also moved to chicago because they were in the search for a better life because in europe and other places farmers |couldn't| raise crops because of the war in there surroundings :period
2 :period farmers could not grow good crops because of the weather and wars
there was war :comma disease :comma insects :comma and bad weather that destroyed a lot of the crops :period

the civil war in the united states changed the way people farm in the south :period
sometimes farmers have to serve the army and cannot plant their crops :period
wars can also make it difficult to earn enough money from farming :period
there are many reasons why people could not make enough money is because of the civil war because some of the farmers had too serve for their troops and because either the plants would get flooded by the rain or by too much sun :period
making money was hard to make for especially for blacks and farmers :period
sometimes farmers have to serve in many army and |can't| work on their farms :period
many people move to chicago because they want better lives because i t was a lot of wars and people |can't| farm if troops are fighting on their land :period
in those years on europe there were a lot of wars and a lot of europeans were farmers their crops were destroyed by the war so they moved to chicago where they had made a lot of railroads that transported people from north :comma south :comma east :comma and west :period
wars was one of the reason people move to chicago :period
people |can't| farm if troops are fighting on their land :period
they had to work hard but made very small money :period
wars made it difficult to earn money from farming :period
the civil war in the u :period s :comma and other wars in different places |didn't| allow people to farm if troops were fighting in their land :period
also weather and wars destroyed crops :period
a lot of people moved because of bad farming situations like the civil war between the u :period s :period a and the confederacy and jobs situation like some people |couldn't| get jobs and they were searching for a better life which they might not have gotten because most of the farmers might have left to go fight in the war or if they had came to just trade goods buy goods and were forced to fight in the civil war :period
after war large plantations were destroyed and many farmers had to rent a place to farm from landowners :period
the civil war in the united states changed the way farming was done in the south :period
then wars also made it difficult for farmers to earn money from farming :period
so many people moved to chicago because they was losing money because the war was coming :comma it rained so much that their crops was getting messed up :comma t hey had to feed the people in the war :comma some people was running out of money and had to move where things |wasn't| so over priced :comma the fungus disease was destroying the crops too another reason why is many |company's| was getting bigger and needed help with their companies
some people moved to chicago because of the war so farmers could not grow their crops and some farmers had to serve in the war other reasons people moved to the city of chicago is for their transportation people wanted a easier way to move their crops :comma pigs and cows they got tired of traveling by boat so chicago made a transportation hub in chicago this way it would be easier to move crops pigs cows and other things some people moved to chicago because clothing other people went for a better life some come to chicago to be able to get a job farming as a butcher or just as a cook some people come to chicago for a new home
i think people moved to chicago because they want better places to live because most people want to survive and grow their crops but wars and diseases are destroying their crops :period
they worked very very hard and got little pay :period
and also because farming in the mid 1800s was hard because of the wars they had :comma and because of the viruses could kill the plants :comma and that made it hard for people to live in :period
also during the wars the farmers could not even plant their crops because the soldiers were using their land :period
and some were farmers so they stopped their farming because all the wars were just trampling over their crops :period
many went in because they felt their lives were ending :period
not only because there |farm's| were getting destroyed but there families would have no where to live :comma eat :comma sleep :comma or even use the washroom :period
some farms were destroyed by the civil war :period
i think so many people move to chicago because of the jobs they offered for people affected by war or viruses in their state or country :period
because people was having wars in the other states and countries :period
many farmers had to live so they can have better lives for example in the civil war that took place in united states so that meant the farmers |couldn't| row plants or earn money and take care of there families and |that's| why people moved to chicago to have a better place to live :period
after the civil war many people had to rent a place to farm from the landowners :period
plantation were destroyed by the war :period
but for some people it |wasn't| like that like black people they has to work very hard and |didn't| earn much money :period
another reason why so many people came to chicago is because their homes were being destroyed by the war :comma for example :comma the italians fought for their independence from austria so that made the civil war in the united states change the way farming was done in the south :period
large plantations were destroyed by the war :period
the italians fought for their independence from australia :period
between 1850 and 1900 there were lots of wars between nations of europe :period
so people cannot farm if troops are fighting on their land :period
also wars cam make it difficult to earn enough money from farming :period
and when there were wars the farmers joined the army and when the war was ove the had to some where else :period
when people have war in other countreys their farms :comma and homes get destroyed :period
large plantations were destroyed many farmers left their homes and families in search fo r better jobs and lives :period
the last reason is that the italians made a war for their independence from austria and they changed the way farming was done :period
sometimes farmers have to serve in the army and cannot work on their |farm's| :period
people can not farm if |troop's| are fighting on their land :period
|war's| can also make it difficult to earn enough money from farming :period
after the civil war large plantations had been destroyed :comma so farmers had to rent a place to farm from landowners :period
wars also affected crops especially when troops were fighting on their land :period
one of the main reson is war too cause people cannot farm :comma and some farmers had to fight with them lots of plantations were destroyed :period
farmers could not farm if troops are fighting on their land and by wars large plantations were destroyed :period
the civil war changed the way farmers were working and the farmers were done in the south large numbers of plant and crops where destroyed by the war so the farmers moved to the united states and fond better jobs and home food and suples to support there families |that's| why the united states has so money people in it and that why it is the 3 rd largest city :period
sometimes the farmers had to surve the army and they h ad to leave there homes and families and there crops :period
another reason was because of war money people did not have good crops because troops were in the middle of war at farmers land and they also would need food so they had to tack some crops to feed the troops so when they would walk out side there food would be gone and steped on :period
|that's| how people loose their money and then they would have to work for other people very very hard and get very little money :period
another reason is because if they were farmers and worked in corn fields or any fields like that there are a lot of things that happened to the crops like they got destroyed by insects :comma by people :comma and massive floods
after the civil war :comma farmers had to rent a place to farm from the landowners :period
large plantations were destroyed by the war :period
sometimes they even served the army and they did not have time for their farm :period
the farmers could not farm if troops are fighting on their farmland :period
wars also made it difficult to earn money from farming :period
and that was in 1850 :period
sometimes farmers were forced to fight :period
there were a lot of wars near their farms :period
that is what many black people had to do :period
after civil war many farmers had to rent a place to farm from the landowners :period
large plantations were destroyed by the war :period
the civial war in the united states changed the way farming was done in the south :period
for example :comma the italians fought for their indepence from austria :period
beetwen 1850 and 1900 :comma there were lots of wars beetween nations of europe :period
sometimes farmers have to serve in the army and cannot work on their farm :period
people cannot farm if troops are fighting on their land :period
wars can also make it difficult to earn enough money from farming :period
people cannot farm if troops are fighting on their land :period
wars can also make it difficult to earn enough money from farming :period
wars also made it difficult :comma because they would use the farming land :period
also crops can get destroyed by wars or by stepping on them farmers moved away and want to find a better job for there families :period
in the civil war that was going on some crops got destroyed as well :period
that resulted into them not growing crops and not having money but most |didn't| have any skills :period
they |couldn't| grow crops correctly because of the weather or because of the war :period
also because of wars like after the civil war many farmers could not do anything on there land and rent a place from other landowners :period
plantations were destroyed by war and farmers had to rent a place to farm from the landowners :period
it was hard for farmers to grow and make a living because of the civil war :period
many people also came to chicago because chicago had a lot of jobs and chicago had safe homes :period
some people are coming to chicago because troops and other people want there lands :period
i feel sorry for people who been planning to grow there crops and the troops destroyed them :period
how i know that is because in the text it says that flood :comma diseases :comma bugs and even wars destroyed the crops :period
but wars can also make it difficult by fighting on their land :period
the weather was not right :comma disease destroyed crop :comma and war :period
the |other's| were sent off to war so they |couldn't| farm either so their crops died because they |couldn't| take care of them :period
some people had troops fighting on their plantation so they |couldn't| farm and their crops was not growing :period
also some people moved to chicago because of the civil war :period
and i think they moved to chicago because chicago |doesn't| have wars and boll |weevill's| and we really |don't| have fungus disease :period
the civil war in the united states changed the way farming was done in the south :period
people can not farm if troops are fighting on their land :period
wars can also make it difficult to earn enough money from farming :period
another reason wars make it hard to farm is because farmers have to serve in the army and cannot work on their farms :period
also wars make it really hard to earn enought money from farming because troops are fighting on their land :period
and the say after the civil war many farmers had to rent a place to farm from the land :dash owners :period
that is what many black people had to do :period
and when the italians and austria was fighting for their independence they were destroying the crops :period
addison to that lots of people came to chicago because people needed money like all the farmers that moved to chicago because all there corps where getting disoyed and they had to potisapt in the civil war :period
they needed few skills or skills that were easy to learn :period
they had to work very :comma very :comma hard but mad very little money :period
but after the civil war many farmers had to rent a place from the land owners :period
another resond they could not make enough money was because framing dont pay much money and they could not farm if troops was fighting another land :period
and some crops have been destroyed during the civil war :period
farmers could grow their crops because people was frighting on they land so they came to chicago and they was looking for jobs like skills that was easy to learn :period
i think they did because in their city they |didn't| have as much water as we were getting and they need mor so they came here ad in their city they |did'nt| have jobs like chicago and when they all moved to chicago they were not skilled on the jobs and they work to get skilled at them and pluse they had no money and most of the people were farmers because the civil war happen in them citys and they could not plant ther crops because it was a flode and the farmers crops were dieing and they needed another plase to plant their crops
and wars was made it difficult to earn enough money :period
people cannot farm if troops are fighting on their land :period
so in oder to make money some farmer starte join the army so they can make money and muer famer start joining the army because they need mour mouny and a of famer got killed in the war other famer packed their thing and move on and start looking for other jobs that |haved't| easy job still to lernd because all they kown how do was famer so they |counld't| do that any mour because of the war :period
the reason so many people came to chicago is because framer |couldn't| farm any more because of the war the war start comeing in your land woer the corp was and moshing the up they |would't| goting on rainfall or sunlight :period
so many people came to chicago because the was living the people was in war in massing up they farm so they had to rent a place to farm in they was not making a lot of money so they moved to chicago :period
because the italians were fighting for independence from austria :period
so a lot of farmer and the |family's| had to move to the north mainly chicago because they needed a job that |didn't| consist on having a lot of skills :comma spontaniuls in europe the same thing was going on but under different circumstanse because instead of a flood farmers had to wory about troop running over and on their crops :period
another reason why a lot of people came to chicago is that :comma in the south it was very expensive to keep a plantation in order :period
this happened because of how people who were having difficulties farming and when the troops were fighting on there land :period
people from europe even moved to chicago because it was too many wars between nations of europe :period
there were a lot of wars and after civil war many farmers have to rent a place to farm from landowners :period
to me one of the reasons people came to chicago is help to get a better life and so them and their kids a live in good plastes without war :period
so they was fighting on their farms :period
then it was wars going on :period
after the civil war many farmers had to rent a place to farm from the landowners :period
large plantations were destroyed by war :period
the civil war in the united states changed the way farming was done in the south :period
for example the italians fought for their independence from austria :period
between 1850 and 1900 :comma there were lots of wars between nations of europe :period
and everything was destroying there land :lparen wninf :rparen most of the farmer plantation was crush by the war :lparen escl2 :period 4 :rparen how farmers are suppose to grow there crops :lparen wninf :rparen when the war are taking it down :lparen escl2 :period 4 :rparen everything was destroying the land :lparen wninf :rparen flood too much sunlight :lparen escl2 :period 3 :rparen :lparen rc2 :period 3 :rparen they |didn't| make enough money to take care of there families :lparen scl2 :period 2 :rparen and :lparen rc2 :period 3 :rparen they was destroyed by insects :lparen escl2 :period 2 :rparen and of the fungus disease destroy the crops :lparen escl2 :period 1 :rparen when they move to chicago :lparen a :rparen they was making a lot of money :lparen wninf :rparen making railroad tracks :lparen escl1 :period 1 :rparen and sailing meat :lparen escl1 :period 2 :rparen almost all the people had jobs :lparen wninf :rparen and the railroads was faster than boats :lparen escl3 :period 2 :rparen and then they had to finish the first of all water route that went both east west and north south :lparen escl3 :period 1 :rparen and then the railroad had become the most popular transportation in the united states :period :lparen escl3 :period 2 :rparen
some of those farmers had to join the army :period
wars also took away form their crops during the :lparen italian and australia :rparen wars they were on other peoples farms during the war and burned other folks crops :period
some people was farming and in the time war was going on so there crops would get mess up for sure :period
black people had to work very hard for very little money or none at all :period
businesses got better and many people started coming and the wars in europe may have been another reason :period
plus it was hard to grow crops do to the bugs :comma rain :comma sunlight :comma and war :period
the farmers in the south came because the civil war was going on and they were losing crop and they had too much rain and that caused a flood in 1915 :period
sometimes farmers could not work on farms had to serve in the army and farm if the troops are fighting on their land :period
many blacks did that :period
after the civil war many farmers had to rent a place to farm from the landowners :period
there are a lot of reasons it can be hard to make enough money from farming :comma like diseases and too much of nature or even fights for our country but its not easy for farmers or any one person who moved to our nice and big city chicago :period
after all of this farmers had to rent a place to farm from landowners which made them lose money which after renting a place gave them little money :period
then again when a war broke out farmers had to stop planting crops if troops were to fight on there land :period
if you have to go to the army you |can't| work on your farm and if you have people going to war on your farm |that's| destroying their crops :period
also :comma because of weather and war :period
up in 1850 and 1900 there was lot of wars between nations of europe :comma they had fought for their independence from austria :period
