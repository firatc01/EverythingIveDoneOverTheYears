the weather also made them come to chicago and grow population :period
i also think that the weather :comma germs :comma and :comma animals made them come to chicago :period
the crops needed the right amount of sunshine and rainfall :comma but sometimes there was too much rainfall which caused floods :period
farming also depended on weather :period
for example in 1915 there was this huge flood that destroyed all the crops and so the farmers needed to find other jobs to pay :period
the other reason i s that farmers needed to move because in the summer there be too much rainfall and also too much sunshine for their crops :period
during the farmers journey it became very hard because disease would destroy the crops and many fungus disease destroyed the potato crop and also because of the weather :period
another reason is that they came to search for better lives for their families because a lot were farmers and were not getting paid enough to support their families and many insects destroyed the crops or sometimes to many rainfalls the crops |don't| grow well :period
for example crops cannot grow without a certain amount of rainfall and a certain amount of sunlight :period
another good reason is that farmers did gain enough money were that crops were destroyed from insects also nature when it rained when it |didn't| and the sun outside
many people also left their countries because they needed to farm in places where there was good weather :comma there had to be a certain amount of rain and sunshine :period
they also had trouble with getting the right amount of rain and sunshine for their crops :period
if their crops had too much rain or too much sun or not enough they would die :period
also another thing that happened in there crops would be that they would flood :period
in :lparen 1848 :rparen many people were impressed of the hub so people wanted in so they brought pigs cows and made meat and other stuff from their land and they started building their own hubs and it caused rich railroad to and then speed boats and they wanted in during the :lparen 1800 :rparen people wanted a better life they |couldn't| grow food cause fungus was on potatoes and people need money so they moved to chicago and they also |couldn't| cause the army was using their land as a battle field and then they burned their crops so they had to move to a better land and then with too much sun they can they but crops need water but a lot of water can flood them an then they will be no use then insects were eating the crops so farmers were driven away to chicago
if there is too much sunshine or rainfall crops |don't| grow well :comma farmers can lose a lot of money :period
farming also depends on weather crops need the right amount of sunshine and rainfall to grow well :period
for example too much rainfall cause massive floods :period
then people came from europe to find better homes farmers needed to find somewhere that the crops wont die from fungus like in ireland and they needed somewhere that had sunshine and rainfall but if there was too much sunshine and too much rainfall crops wont grow well and farmers wont make any money :period
the same thing happened in europe :period
in the summer of 1915 :comma too much rainfall caused massive floods that ruined crops on thousands of farms in the southern united states :period
farming also depends on water :period
in 1915 too much rainfall cause massive floods that ruined crops on thousands of farms in the southern united states :period
or if the crops |don't| grow like they are supposed to the farmers lose lots of money :period
also crops needed just the right amount of sun :comma and rain and chicago never got too much rain of sun or even snow so many farmers moved here because of that to and |that's| why so many people moved to chicago :period
but that |wasn't| just it people who had farms had massive floods and their crops will wash away or mess up plus they came for the jobs because where they were they did not have to many job s to choose from so they moved the chicago :period
in the summer of 1915 too much rain caused massive floods that ruined crops on thousands of farms in the southern united states :period
the cops need the right amount of sunshine and rainfall to grow well :period
to find good jobs and a good place so they can farm :comma because were they live it was hard to farm because there probably was notable to because of weather or the wars :period

they left ireland and their countries because the weather :period
if there is a lot of sun and water the crops will die and the farmers will lose a lot of money :period
the crops need enough sunshine and water to grow :period
in 1915 too much water fell and it caused a flood that ruined thousands in the southern united states :period

another reason was weather :period
another reason why people moved to chicago is because you could have a better life in chicago sometimes farmers had to move away from their crops because of floods and other disasters like diseases and insects :period
another reason was because it rained a lot and sometimes it overflows |that's| why :period
those are my reasons why some of the farmers moved here to the united states :period
that is why they need the right weather not too sunny nor too rainy :period

like in the summer of 1915 :comma too much rainfall caused massive floods that ruined crops on thousands of farms in the southern united states :period
if theirs too much rainfall crops |don't| grow well :comma and farmers can lose a lot of money :period
weather may be another reason why crops get ruined crops need the right amount of sunshine and rainfall to grow well :period
there are many reasons why people could not make enough money is because of the civil war because some of the farmers had too serve for their troops and because either the plants would get flooded by the rain or by too much sun :period
crops need the same amount of sunshine and water :comma because in the summer of 1915 the rainfall caused major flooding in the southern united states and it happened the same in europe :period
the weather is another disaster for crops :period
also :comma people in other countries wanted to farm on better grass land :comma so they also wanted to go where |there's| not to much rain or wind to mess up their crops :period

crops needed the right amount of sunshine and rainfall to grow well and if they |didn't| farmers would lose a lot of money :period
i t soon spread to other southern states but not in the northern states and crops needed sunshine and rainfall so they went to chicago and 1930 chicago |didn't| have the insects that eat crops chicago finally were building canals :comma towers :comma and other stuff and |that's| how they got more population in chicago :period
and people that was farmers need there water to grow their crops :period
so many people moved to chicago because they was losing money because the war was coming :comma it rained so much that their crops was getting messed up :comma t hey had to feed the people in the war :comma some people was running out of money and had to move where things |wasn't| so over priced :comma the fungus disease was destroying the crops too another reason why is many |company's| was getting bigger and needed help with their companies
if there are not too much sunshine or too much rainfall :comma crop |don't| grow well :comma and farmers can lose a lot of money :comma and they knew that chicago jobs are getting bigger :comma and they need people to work them :period
farmers need the right amount of rain :comma and sun if they receive the right amount of sun and water or rain the crops would not grow :period
another reason why i think that they moved to chicago is because of the weather :period
or there will be a flood and the plant can drown :period
a second reason so many people moved to chicago i s because i n the mid :dash to late |1800's| europe and the u :period s :period did not have the right weather to raise a farm with too much rain or too much sunlight :period
if there are too many rainfalls the crops |don't| grow as well as you imagine it will be :period
in the 1830 :dash 1930 people were starting to move to chicago because there were a lot of floods :period
if it was too watery or too sunny the crops |woudn't| grow :exclpoint

too much rainfall makes floods ruin crops and too much sunshine can cause droughts causing crops dying :period
people in other countries have hard times making crops cause they need right amount of sunshine and rainfall :period
if there is too much rainfall or sunshine :comma crops |don't| grow well and farmers can lose lots of money :comma wars can also make a difficult to earn enough money from farming :period
farming also depends on the weather crops need the right amount of sunshine and rainfall to grow well :period
because insects and weather many people |can't| have other jobs :comma houses or money and they work so hard to help their family and live :period
for example theyre crops were often eaten by tiny bugs or had fungus disease or the crops got to many rain or to much sunlight :period
crops need the right amount of sunshine and rainfall to grow :period
farming also depends on weather :period
and the same thing happened in europe :period
:dash of farms in the southern united states :period
in 1915 too much rainfall caused massive floods that ruined crops :dash

some get no water and they still die :period
other times the crops get to much water and are flooded and die :period
it happened to many farms :period
to much rain fall can make a flood on their crops :period

if there is too much rainfall or to much sunshine |crop's| |don't| grow well :period
crops need the right amount of sunshine and rain to grow well :period
3 :period reason is because the farmers would be working and would be planting crops and the weather |wouldn't| be the right wheather for the crops :comma so then if it rains too much the crops would get destroyed and if its too much sunshine then the crops |won't| grow at all :period
too much rain fell :comma and caused flooding which ruined thousands of crops in the southern u :period s :period and europe :period
weather can also destroy crops because cros need the right amount of sunshine and water :comma but if they get too much :comma the crop |won't| grow so well :period
weather they needed the right amount of rainfall and sunshine if there is too much of both then they would not grow how they should :period
diseases destroyed their crops :comma crops were destroyed by insects :comma if there was too much sunshine or too much rainfall :comma crops |don't| grow well :comma and farmers can lose a lot of money :period
and it depends on the weather because if the crop get to much rain and to much sun the rain could end up in a flood and a sun can make the ctops thirsty very fast and can drie up fast so a lot of people came to chicago :period
in the summer of 1915 too much rain caused massive floods and rowind the crops :period
if there was to much rain or to much sun the will not grow well and farmers will lose there money so they moved to chicago :period
another reason is because if they were farmers and worked in corn fields or any fields like that there are a lot of things that happened to the crops like they got destroyed by insects :comma by people :comma and massive floods
for example :comma in the summer of 1918 :comma to much rain caused floods that ruined crops on thousands of farms :period
but sometimes they got to much rain or sunshine :period
their crops needed the right amount of sunshine and rainfall to grow well :period
farming also depended on weather :period

that resulted into them not growing crops and not having money but most |didn't| have any skills :period
they |couldn't| grow crops correctly because of the weather or because of the war :period
the reason is because a flood would mess up the land :period
or they could not grow anything because to much rain or to much sunshine :period
the farming also was depend on the weather they had and europe they had to search for better homes :period
how i know that is because in the text it says that flood :comma diseases :comma bugs and even wars destroyed the crops :period
but you |can't| let it be in the light in lot and water it too much because it will not grow :period
and that something happened in europe :period
sometimes the wheather |don't| be write because they get to much sunshine and to much rainfalls and when they get that they crops die :period
to much of this and the crops |won't| grow so good :period
passage 1 :colon |'the| search for a better |life'| is about how farmers need the right amount of sunshine and the rainfall to grow their crops :period

i think so many people came to chicago because they |couldn't| be farmers europe because of the rainfall and bad weather :period
b1 :comma b13a
and do not mension the floods in the southern united stated :period
the same thing happen in europe they |didn't| have enough money to fee their families :period
i think they did because in their city they |didn't| have as much water as we were getting and they need mor so they came here ad in their city they |did'nt| have jobs like chicago and when they all moved to chicago they were not skilled on the jobs and they work to get skilled at them and pluse they had no money and most of the people were farmers because the civil war happen in them citys and they could not plant ther crops because it was a flode and the farmers crops were dieing and they needed another plase to plant their crops
but some say they left because they wanted better job skills to make more money and their country had bad weather :period
farming also depends on weather :period
the reason so many people came to chicago is because framer |couldn't| farm any more because of the war the war start comeing in your land woer the corp was and moshing the up they |would't| goting on rainfall or sunlight :period
so a lot of farmer and the |family's| had to move to the north mainly chicago because they needed a job that |didn't| consist on having a lot of skills :comma spontaniuls in europe the same thing was going on but under different circumstanse because instead of a flood farmers had to wory about troop running over and on their crops :period
because a plantation need the right amount of sunshine and water to be healthy :period
also in the summer of 1915 too much rain fall caused massive floods that ruined crops on thousand of farms is the southern united states :period
if there was too much sunshine or rain feel to much :comma then the crops |wouldn't| grow well :period

the farmers depend on the weather because if |it's| too much sunny or rainfall their plants |wouldn't| grow and because of the disease of the plants can catch and some are destroyed by insects :period
plus it was hard to grow crops do to the bugs :comma rain :comma sunlight :comma and war :period
the farmers in the south came because the civil war was going on and they were losing crop and they had too much rain and that caused a flood in 1915 :period
