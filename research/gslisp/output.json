Only released in Japan it is a easy game to play in Japanese but can be quite expensive to import but is it worth it?<br \/>\n<br \/>\nGameplay- The game has lots of Vocaloid songs, the aim of the game is to get a high enough score to pass the level. The song will have a video in the back ground and shapes of the buttons will appear on the back, that button will fly in from the screen and you have to press it in time. (May have explained it poorly but its hard to explain the best thing to do is to look it up on YouTube.) Reaching certain scores will unlock new songs to play along with new costumes for Miku to wear, and new items for her room. Miku's room is a part of the game where you can decorate her room with the items you have unlocked with rewards you unlock from songs. Its a very small part of the game but is still fun to play are with every so often. <br \/>\n<br \/>\nGraphics- Besides seeing cute Miku the game has been very well developed with very good animation of Miku's dancing and movements. The video's are also very well put together and entertaining, as well as fitting into the music well.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nSound- the sound is great if you love Miku's music, if not or you don't know what it is then I suggest you look it up and listen to it 1st as its not for everyone.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nReplay value- The game has a lot of replay value and is very fun to play. Its a great game that you can keep coming back to and playing.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nSummary- If you are a fan of Vocaloid and the whole music scene around it then I really recommend it. If you're not then I don't recommend it. Very easy to play in Japanese, but can be quite expensive to import. Great music and fun to play and that why I recommend this game to anyone who is interested.<br \/>\n<br \/>\n+ Great Music<br \/>\n+ Great Animation<br \/>\n+ Nice extras<br \/>\n+ Easy to play in Japanese<br \/>\n+ Easy to play Hard to master<br \/>\n<br \/>\n- Can be very expensive<br \/>\n- Requires the scene of music<br \/>\n  "},{"score_details":"\n  <dt>Difficulty:<\/dt>\n <dd>Hard<\/dd>\n    <dt>Time Spent:<\/dt>\n <dd>20 to 40 Hours<\/dd>\n    <dt>The Bottom Line:<\/dt>\n <dd>\"Highly addictive\"<\/dd>\n  ","url":"http:\/\/www.gamespot.com\/hatsune-miku-project-diva\/user-reviews\/720479\/","meta":"\n <div class=\"wrap\">\n <p class=\"username\"><em property=\"v:reviewer\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.gamespot.com\/users\/Out-Of-Ammo\/\">Out-Of-Ammo<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n <div class=\"avatar\">\n <a style=\"background-image:url(http:\/\/k.min.us\/jjL9ZQ.gif)\" href=\"http:\/\/www.gamespot.com\/users\/Out-Of-Ammo\/\"><\/a>\n <\/div>\n <div class=\"score\">\n <div rel=\"v:rating\" class=\"score_wrap\">\n <a href=\"http:\/\/www.gamespot.com\/hatsune-miku-project-diva\/user-reviews\/720479\/\"><span property=\"v:value\" class=\"numeric\">9<\/span><span content=\"10\" property=\"v:best\"><\/span><br \/>superb<\/a>\n <\/div>\n <\/div>\n <h2 property=\"v:summary\" class=\"deck\">One of the best Rhythm games on the PSP.<\/h2>\n <ul class=\"details\"><li class=\"first\">Posted <span property=\"v:dtreviewed\">May 15, 2010 3:43 am GMT<\/span><\/li><li>Recommended by 1 of 1 user.<\/li><\/ul> <\/div>\n ","body":"\n Hatsune Miku: Project Diva is a Rhythm\/Music game developed by Sega for the PSP.  While it was only released in Japan, many people willingly imported it from Japan, such as myself.  Here is my review.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nGraphics:  8\/10<br \/>\n<br \/>\nGraphics in Hatsune Miku: Project Diva are very cute and almost cel-shaded.  The gameplay is built to where, even during gameplay, you can see the beautiful graphics of each cleverly made music video very well, and all costumes are very good-looking as well.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nStory:  NA\/10<br \/>\n<br \/>\nWith the fact that Hatsune Miku: Project Diva is a Rhythm game, story isn't a very important aspect.  There IS actually sort of a story in it, which goes something like Hatsune Miku is trying to reach the top of the music charts to a big concert, or something like that.  But if you don't know Japanese (like me), you won't understand it very well.  And if you want a great story in a game, the Rhythm\/Music genre is not where you want to look for it. <br \/>\n<br \/>\nGameplay:  10\/10<br \/>\n<br \/>\nGameplay in Hatsune Miku: Project Diva is addictive and, most importantly, fun.  The aspect is simple, press buttons at the correct time.  Such as most Rhythm games.  However, something about the gameplay sucks you in, and you will want to complete every song on every difficulty, just so you can unlock a new costume or house venue.  The buttons will appear all over the screen, which will make it easy to see, along with making it to where you can look at the nice visuals as well.  <br \/>\n<br \/>\nSound:  10\/10<br \/>\n<br \/>\nThe sound in Hatsune Miku: Project Diva in just incredible!  There aren't many sound effects, which is probably because of the fact that you will be playing along to music in the game.  There is a wide variety of songs, including many rock, ballads, polka, dance, jungle beats, hip hop, and others, but every song has a certain J-Pop essence in it, which makes sure that every song in every genre is still just as catchy and addictive, no matter what genre you like or hate.  <br \/>\n<br \/>\nDifficulty (on a scale of 1 to 10):  8\/10<br \/>\n<br \/>\nThe gameplay in Hatsune Miku: Project Diva is not as difficult as it is punishing.  Not only do you have to hit the buttons, but you have to hit them at a PRECISE time.  And if you don't, you won't get as high of a score.  But once you get used to it, you can start doing much better at songs, and getting through a difficult song is extremely satisfying.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nReplay Value:  10\/10<br \/>\n<br \/>\nOnce you have played through most of the songs, there is a lot of stuff to do.  You can try harder difficulties to get better costumes and other things in the game, and not matter how many times you play through a song, it is still just as addicting.  <br \/>\n<br \/>\nIs it Import Friendly?<br \/>\n<br \/>\nYes, yes it is.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nThe simple gameplay in Project Diva makes needing to know Japanese not very important.  The only real time you might need help figuring out a translation is when you are on the main menu, as the main menu is in Japanese.  And if you need a translation for the main menu, just copy and paste this link into your toolbar.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nhttp:\/\/projectdiva.wikispaces.com\/<br \/>\n<br \/>\nAll in all, this is probably one of the most Import Friendly games for sale.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nOverall Score:  9\/10<br \/>\n<br \/>\nHatsune Miku: Project Diva is an addictive PSP Rhythm game that, if you are willing to shell out the money for it, is definently worth a purchase.

You get very relaxed by hearing some of the Songs, especially when you've gotten Great on the songs you like the most, because of the PV mode you can watch the whole song as a Music video and even take screen shots of your Favoirt Moment in the video. The more cooler part is that you're able to play as the other Vocaloid characters too, but don't think that is a positive part, since those characters doesn't have their own voice in the game, but you can get great Cosplays for Miku, so she can dress up in cloths fitting to the songs or after your like. For those who hasn't played this game, I would recommend you to play the game and have fun with singing and playing with Miku.

If you don't know Miku Hatsune, or you don't like anime, you probably won't like this game too much. To counter that point, it is an accessible rhythm game, that's quite fun to play. It's very comparable to OSU (Elite Beat Agents) without a stylus. There are only 4 buttons in the game that are in use during gameplay. The main point is to push the button when it overlaps its matching symbol on screen. It's simple, and it works... well, for the most part. It's easy to compare it to other rhythm games out there, and compared to Guitar Hero or DDR, Project Diva feels less organic in the way you hit the notes. This is where the punishing difficulty comes in. By organic, I mean (as a skilled rhythm game player) I usually don't have to look at where the note hits, I just have to know what button I'm hitting. In this game, it is impossible to do that. You have to watch the notes at all time, which takes away some of the fun of a rhythm game. To be quite honest, if this was all the game was, just some rhythm game with songs I don't really know, and less than average gameplay I'd just put the game down and not even bother writing a review. But it's everything else that comes with the game that makes it good. The game is all about Miku, and that's why it'd help to know who she is. (Google her) All throughout the game Miku is in the background dancing to every song, and singing along. The animation is great, and incredibly fun to watch. After a song is beaten with a high enough score you can watch without any notes flying across the screen. Also, there are a ton, and I mean a ton, of things to collect in this game, from outfits, to room customization, to custom songs. Yes, this game is in Japanese, but if you have a modded system there are English patches out there, and you don't even need to patch to enjoy these extra features. There are an insane amount of costumes to get, and you can mess around with Miku's room, adding stuff for the shelves, different room themes, stuff for the walls, a drum set, just a whole lot of fun stuff. The song customization is absolutely insane. You can do everything from choosing rooms for her to be in, to how she dances, to the camera angles, to her mouth movements! It may take a while, but a worth while song is quite a sight to see.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nNow to talk about the lag. Overall the game is deserving of an 8, maybe 8.5, but it is inexcusable for a game out on a console where graphics can't be controlled to have lag. Yes, it only lags on a 1000, but that's all I've got, and I'm sure a lot of people still love their 1000's. Yes, I've overclocked my 1000, yet performance was not improved. The first half of the great song list are playable without lag at all, but the second half are unplayable. It is absolutely impossible to unlock hard mode on every song, and though they are passable on easy, it is not fun at all having to play below my difficulty level. It honestly kills the game for 1000 gamers.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nAnyway let's break it down!<br \/>\nGameplay - 7 - It's not incredibly special in itself. As I said, it is not organic at all, and feels more like a chore to hit the notes than fun to move along with the song and easily breeze through the notes.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nGraphics &amp; graphical extras - 10 - The graphics are impressive, pushing the limits on what the PSP can achieve. This may be its downfall, as it could be what induces lag. Also, the loading screens are nearly all different, and you are able to take screenshots from in-game footage, or a picture gallery and save them as a JPG to your mem stick, which is quite awesome.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nSound - 7 - Alright, let me get this straight, the songs are great. Each and everyone is a blast to listen to. It's the menus that are awful. It's always the same 10 sec loop that makes me turn my PSP off if I'm not going to choose a different song right away.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nTilt - 9 - I'll give it some credit, this has a lot of extras that save the game from being just an average rhythm game, and it is highly import friendly, so anyone should be able to pick it up.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nFinal thoughts<br \/>\nIt's basically a fan service, which is fine. The game is fun for fans, and probably not for non-fans. There are a ton of fans though, so if you're not, perhaps you should become one? If that's not on your agenda, don't pick it up. Also, if you own a 1000, be prepared to be disappointed.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nFor 1000's - 6.5<br \/>\nFor anything higher - 8.5  "},{"score_details":"\n  <dt>Difficulty:<\/dt>\n <dd>Just Right<\/dd>\n    <dt>Time Spent:<\/dt>\n <dd>100 or More Hours<\/dd>\n    <dt>The Bottom Line:<\/dt>\n <dd>\"Masterpiece\"<\/dd>\n  ","url":"http:\/\/www.gamespot.com\/hatsune-miku-project-diva\/user-reviews\/709001\/","meta":"\n <div class=\"wrap\">\n <p class=\"username\"><em property=\"v:reviewer\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.gamespot.com\/users\/saturnfireflie\/\">saturnfireflie<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n <div class=\"avatar\">\n <a style=\"background-image:url(http:\/\/userimage.gamespot.com\/images\/icon\/0\/2\/22845213634795534563001362353720\/icon.jpg)\" href=\"http:\/\/www.gamespot.com\/users\/saturnfireflie\/\"><\/a>\n <\/div>\n <div class=\"score\">\n <div rel=\"v:rating\" class=\"score_wrap\">\n <a href=\"http:\/\/www.gamespot.com\/hatsune-miku-project-diva\/user-reviews\/709001\/\"><span property=\"v:value\" class=\"numeric\">9<\/span><span content=\"10\" property=\"v:best\"><\/span><br \/>superb<\/a>\n <\/div>\n <\/div>\n <h2 property=\"v:summary\" class=\"deck\">Outstanding!

At this point I still need to get Hard-Great on a few more songs and get the swimsuits for a few more characters.<br \/>\n<br \/>\n<br \/>\nGraphics &amp; Sound:<br \/>\nBeautiful scenery and there are really cute outfits for Miku to wear!! (^o^). I also have to say that the music is very catchy and cute - if you are a fan of j-pop and cute Japanese culture then scoop up this game!<br \/>\n<br \/>\nGameplay:<br \/>\nOnce I got a guide for what the menus meant (and guides are very easy to find, so don't let a language barrier stop you from getting this game) it became very easy to navigate.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nI also enjoy rhythm games, so I find the gameplay enjoyable (match the buttons to the beat ^^). Especially since I cannot understand Japanese story modes; therefore, this game has been a great import for me.<br \/>\n <br \/>\nAnother thing to keep the game alive after you have completed the modules, is the ability to create your own music video by uploading an mp3 and then frame by frame directing Miku's dance moves, facial expressions and the camera angel.<br \/>\n* This part has proved to be quite difficult, despite some guides being available online. However, I am pushing onward (hopefully one day I will finish my video).<br \/>\nIn this mode you can also play other people's custom made videos - however, again I have not figured out how to do this. <br \/>\nThe only thing I suggest is that this part of the game be more intuitive - I would love to play other people's creations as well as display my own -- hopefully soon ;)<br \/>\n  "}]]
